## Kibi/Kibana Alert & Reporting App
> Watching your data, 24/7/365

---

**SENTINL** extends *Kibi/Kibana* with **Alerting** and **Reporting** functionality to monitor, notify and report on data series changes using standard queries, programmable validators and a variety of configurable actions - Think of it as a free an independent ["Watcher"](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/watcher/current/introduction.html) and ["Reporting"](https://www.elastic.co/products/reporting) alternative, further extended and expanded by the unique Kibi features

**SENTINL** is also designed to simplify the process of creating and managing alerts and reports in Kibi/Kibana via its integrated  App and Spy integration.
